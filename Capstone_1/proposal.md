**Title:** Predicting patient hospital experience in Medicare hospitals

**Problem:**  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has developed summary star ratings based on patient hospital experience  survey results to make it easier for consumers to use the information on the Hospital compare website (https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/search.html?) and to spotlight excellence in healthcare quality. To get these start ratings, hospitals must have at least 100 completed surveys over a given four-quarter period. In addition, hospitals must be eligible for public reporting of survey measures. Hospitals with fewer than 100 completed surveys don't get star ratings. Our goal in this project is therefore, to build a machine learning model to predict the summary star ratings (i.e. patient experience) of the hospitals based on the multitude of measures reported in the hospital compare data for around 4000 hospitals in the US in the abcense of the survey results. These  measures constitute around 100 different hospital characteristics including among others information on number of readmissions, hospital type, safety of care, timliness of care, treatment outcome, and spending per patient. 

**Client:** Private hospital owners and local county governments are potential customers of such a model. They can use the result to inverstigate whether or not they meet the criteria for Medicare reimbursements. Furthermore, they can exploit the model to improve the quality of care they provide. On the other hand, CMS can also benefit from the results of such model in the abcense of survey results. Data on patient experience (alternatively patient satisfaction) are now utilized by the US center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in determining payment to health-care organizations for taking care of patients. In 2015 CMS released a new star ratings for US hospitals based on patient experience.
