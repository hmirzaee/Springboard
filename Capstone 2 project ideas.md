For my second capstone project I would like to explore with time-series analysis and forecasting methodologies. These are my three suggestions:

## Store sales forcasting
### Data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting
Abstract: The data contains historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores in different regions. It can be used to project sales for each department in each store. Here, predicting sales behevior on major holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data is of major interest. The result of such project would be relevant to retail stores.

## Web traffic time series forcasting
