For my second capstone project I would like to explore with time-series analysis and forecasting methodologies. These are my three suggestions:

## Store sales forcasting
### Data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting
Abstract: The data contains historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores in different regions. It can be used to project sales for each department in each store. Here, predicting sales behevior on major holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data is of major interest. The result of such project would be relevant to retail stores.

## Web traffic time series forcasting
### Data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting
Abstract: Here we focus on the problem of forecasting the future values of multiple time series, as it has always been one of the most challenging problems in the field. More specifically, the aim is to forecast future web traffic for approximately 145,000 Wikipedia articles. The result of such modeling is useful in any context that requires a web plan which should include realistic estimates of projected web traffic. Regardless of whether a website strategy involves selling products, or bringing in community members, or even developing content, in all cases measuring website traffic and user sessions is a good way to gauge how many people are using the site, and where there is a need for improvement.

## Purchase forcasting and customer segmentation for precision marketing
### Data: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail
Abstract: This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. Analysis for this dataset could include time series, clustering, classification, recommendation, and more.
